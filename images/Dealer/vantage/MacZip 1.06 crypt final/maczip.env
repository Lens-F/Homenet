#  Enviroment File for MacZip#  ==========================#  Maczip's  default  behavior  may  be  modified  via options#  placed in an "environment variable". This file simulates#  the process environment.#  This can be done  with any  option.#  Use var-name "ZIPOPT" for zip- and "UNZIP"#  for the unzip-module (see example below)#  Background:#  Under Unix: Each Process (= running Program) has a set of #  associated variables. The variables are called enviroment #  variables and, together, constitute the process environment.#  These variables include the search path, the terminal type,#  user's login name and user defined variables.#  Unfortunatelly the MacOS has no equivalent. So we need #  a file to emulate the environment variables.#  Name of this file is "MacZip.Env". It can be placed#  in the current folder of MacZip or in the #  preference folder of the system disk. #  If MacZip founds the "MacZip.Env" file in the same #  folder of MacZip the "MacZip.Env" file in the #  preference folder will be ignored.#  An environment variable has a name and a value:#  Name=Value#  Note: Spaces are significant:#  ZIPOPT=-r  and#  ZIPOPT = -r are different !!!#  Layout of this file: Comments must start with a '#'. Empty#  lines and comments are ignored. Linebreaks of this file#  must be in Macintosh format, DOS or Unix linebreaks will #  not work correctly. To check the "MacZip.Env" file select#  the menu File->Show Enviroment.#  The filename must be "MacZip.Env" (case insensitiv). #  Choose your favorite editor to edit this file. #  Filetype and filecreator are not important.#  Note to performance: Keep this file as small as possible.#  Every start of zip or unzip will load and parse this file.#  You can delete all comments. (lines starting with '#')# ============================================================# ============================================================#  Options ZIPOPT and UNZIPOPT are case sensitiv. All others#  switches are not case sensitiv.#  Default option for the Zip-Module (see MANUAL for more info)#  Uncomment to activate the environment variable# ZIPOPT= -N -r#  Default option for the Unzip-Module (see unzip.doc for more info)# UNZIPOPT= -o#  By default, Maczip extracts each archive in a unique folder.#  This option suppresses this behavior.#  It is probably most useful with the -o modifier.# Default: UniqueUnzipFolders=Yes# UniqueUnzipFolders=No#  This option forces an auto-test of each created archive.#  This  option  extracts  each specified  file  in  memory  #  and  compares  the CRC (cyclic redundancy check, an #  enhanced checksum)  of the  expanded  file with the original #  file's stored CRC value (It's like the option UNZIP -t )# Default: TestArchiveAfterwards=No# TestArchiveAfterwards=Yes#  You can switch from the default behavior moving to the trash to #  immediate deletion.#  When moving to the trash, it is possible to zip files and be able #  to recover them properly later on. Even if you know what you #  are doing, it is possible to make irrecoverable mistakes.#  So be careful with this option, especially when used with the #  options "-df" or "-X".# Default: Immediate_File_Deletion=No# Immediate_File_Deletion=Yes#  MacZip popups a warning box if you are doing something that #  can be dangerous. This option supresses the warning box.# Default: NoWarningBoxes=no# NoWarningBoxes=Yes#  Forces MacZip to do not quit automatically#  Default: AutoQuit=yes# AutoQuit=no
